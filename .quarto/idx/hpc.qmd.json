These computers are much more powerful than your laptop or even desktops in the lab. \n\nRunning computational chemistry calculations requires the use of these powerful computers.

Type **`ssh [username]@slogin.palmetto.clemson.edu`**\n3. Enter your password\n\nThis logs you in to a computer called the \"login node\". \"Node\" is a computing term for a single computational unit within a cluster of computers.\n\n## Directory Structure and Creating Files\nJust as your laptop has folders and files, you can create folders and files on Palmetto. In computing, folders are called directories.\n\n1. Make a new directory to store your tutorials. \n   \n   **`mkdir tutorials`**\n2. To check your work, type **`ls`** to list all directories and files. You should see `tutorials`.\n3. Make a file in the tutorials directory. First, move into that directory.\n\n   **`cd tutorials`**\n4. What would you see if you typed **`ls`** here? Try it to check your understanding. \n5. To open a new file called `my_file`, type\n   \n   **`vim my_file`**\n   \n   This opens a new file with an editor called `vim`.\n6. To write in this file, press `a` for `append`. Then begin typing a phrase.\n7. Once you have finished typing, press `esc` to leave editing mode.\n8. To save and close your file, type `:wq`. `w` is for `write` (or save) and `q` is for `quit`.\n\n## Check your understanding\n\n<div class=\"quiz\">\n  <p><b>If you were to type ls here, what would you see?</b></p>\n  <button onclick=\"wrong()\">No files</button>\n  <button onclick=\"correct()\">A file named my_file</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nfunction correct() {\n  alert(\"Correct! ls lists files in your directory which now includes your new file);\n}\nfunction wrong() {\n  alert(\"Try again.\");\n}\n</script>\n\n9. Now, let's add to the file. Paste the following text into `my_file`. To paste, open the file, type `a`, and right-click paste. Save and close using `:wq`.\n\n10. There are a few options for viewing the contents of this file.\n\n   - Use cat to view all contents. `cat my_file`\n   - Use tail to view the end of the file. `tail my_file`\n   - Use head to view the beginning of the file. `head my_file`\n\n11.
