You should see tutorials.\nMake a file in the tutorials directory. First, move into that directory.\ncd tutorials\nWhat would you see if you typed ls here? Try it to check your understanding.\nTo open a new file called my_file, type\nvim my_file\nThis opens a new file with an editor called vim.\nTo write in this file, press a for append. Then begin typing a phrase.\nOnce you have finished typing, press esc to leave editing mode.\nTo save and close your file, type :wq. w is for write (or save) and q is for quit."
